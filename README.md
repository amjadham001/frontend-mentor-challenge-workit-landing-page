## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Notes:

- What belongs in @font-face?

  - font-family
  - src
  - font-weight
  - font-style
  - font-display
  - (optionally) font-stretch, unicode-range, etc.

- What does not belong in @font-face?

  - font-optical-sizing
  - font-variation-settings
  - Any property that controls how the font is rendered on the element, not how it is loaded

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This tool helped me to view and inspect the design in more detail such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`, to get a perfect and consistent result.
